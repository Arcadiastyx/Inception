# Start recomandation : 
1. Create the files structure has expected in the subject.
2. take care of the Server by implementing the NGINX contenair.
3. take care fo the Worldpress contenair.
4. take care of the MariaDB contenair.
5. Link contenairs
6. Manage volums
7. Clean the code in order to finish the project

### Tips : 
As you will need to perform installations with sudo, it will not be possible to use the school's machine for correction. You will need a virtual machine that you can launch via VirtualBox, download your desired ISO system (Debian, Ubuntu, etc...), and configure your VM. PLEASE NOTE the memory and disk space required for the ISO installation.

## Docker CMD : 
Docker build + "Path to the dockerfile" = Create the conetenaire
Docker image ls = Heart files from devian/other
